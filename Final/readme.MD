FPGA

Insertion Sort (MAX to MIN)

The circuit also separetely records the addresses of thes orted array.

Example:
Memory (4 words):
15
200
3
200

The sorted list in the registers: 200, 200, 15, 3
The addresses in the address registers: 4, 2, 1, 3

Input data in dat file are for initializing the memory.
